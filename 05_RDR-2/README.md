## ⚙️ How It Works

The app is built using **React** with the following structure:

- **App**: 🏠 The main component contains the state for controlling the background image and text content. It uses `setInterval` to update the background and text every 5 seconds.
- **Navbar**: 📑 A simple navbar that can be extended with additional features or links.
- **Hero**: 💪 Displays dynamic hero text that changes with the background.
- **Background**: 🖼️ Displays the dynamic background images based on the `heroCount` state.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **React**: ⚛️ JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: 🎨 For styling and ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: 💻 For handling dynamic state changes, like cycling through the background images and hero text.
